GitHub is a cloud-based developer platform that uses the Git version control system to host, manage, and share code and other project files. It is the largest source code host in the world and is owned by Microsoft. 
Core Concepts
Git: An open-source, distributed version control system (VCS) that tracks changes in files and code over time, allowing developers to revert to previous versions and view the project's history.
Repository (Repo): A digital folder or storage space on GitHub where your project and its entire history of changes are stored. Repositories can be public (visible to anyone) or private (restricted access).
Collaboration Tools: GitHub adds a web-based interface and powerful collaboration features on top of Git, such as:
Branches: Allow developers to work on different features or versions of a project simultaneously without affecting the main codebase.
Commits: Snapshots of the changes made to files at a specific point in time, which are recorded in the project's history.
Pull Requests (PRs): A mechanism for developers to propose their changes to the main codebase, allowing others to review, discuss, and approve the changes before they are merged in.
Issue Tracking: Tools for reporting bugs, requesting software features, and managing tasks within a project. 
Why use GitHub?
Collaboration: Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously, tracking changes and merging contributions seamlessly.
Version Control: Easily manage and track changes, experiment with new ideas on separate branches, and revert to earlier, stable versions if needed.
Portfolio Building: Developers can showcase their work by creating a public profile and hosting open-source projects, which is an essential skill for job seekers.
Community and Resources: Access a massive community, extensive documentation on GitHub Docs, and a wide range of open-source projects for learning and inspiration.

Install Git on your local machine if you want to work offline and sync your changes later.
